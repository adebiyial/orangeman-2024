### How I got here.

At about three/four (pick one :() years ago, I came across D3 because I
felt the need to learn how to build awesome visualizations for dashboards.
But even though I took baby steps, it was until January 2022 that began my
journey. Having spent a year—on and off—learning D3 now, I feel like I've
and still on a voyage. It has awaken something fundamentally interesting
in me. I no longer just want to build visualizations for dashboard, I want
to do more. D3, and by extension Data Visualization, I find is a very
interesting field.
