import CardPerspectiveHover from "../../components/playground/card-perspectiver-hover.astro";
import CardPerspectiveHoverAnatomy from "../../components/playground/card-perspectiver-hover-anatomy.astro";

The trick here is to distinguish each corner such that there is a `top-left`, `top-right`, `bottom-left`, and `bottom-right`.
Then apply the desired hover effect on any of those corners&mdash;in this case a `transform` combination of `perspective` and `rotate`.

<div class="demo">
  <CardPerspectiveHoverAnatomy />
</div>

If you can move the individual corners separately, then, with a little tweak, you can move the card holistically through layering:

<div class="demo">
  <CardPerspectiveHover />
</div>

The compromise and drawback here is that you can't have your cake and eat it: since the corners need to be hovered, any foreground content will need to have its pointer events disabled.
For example, try to highlight the text "Hover over me 😐" above. See?

```html
<div class="wrap">
  <div class="pseudo top-left"></div>
  <!-- other sides like top-right &| bottom-[left|right] -->
  <div class="card">
    <h1>Hover over me 😐</h1>
  </div>
</div>
```

```css
.card {
  transform: perspective(var(--perspective)) rotateX(var(--rotateX)) rotateY(var(--rotateY));
}

.top-left {
  inset: 0 auto auto 0;

  /* On hover, effect the card—instead of the corner */
  &:hover ~ .card {
    --perspective: 600px;
    --rotateX: 10deg;
    --rotateY: -10deg;
  }
}
```
